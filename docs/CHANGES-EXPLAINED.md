## List the test files instead of pointing at the folder

**What changed.** `scripts/test.mjs` ran `node --test tests/`. It now reads the
`tests` folder itself, collects every `*.test.cjs` file, and passes that list
to the runner. It also fails on purpose if the list comes back empty.

**Why.** Node's built in test runner takes a list of test files, and the two
Node versions we support disagree about what a folder name means:

* On Node 20, `tests/` is understood as a directory to look inside. Glob
  patterns are not supported.
* On Node 22, arguments are matched as glob patterns, so the plain word
  `tests/` is treated as the name of one file. No such file exists, so nothing
  runs.

Swapping one for the other just moves the breakage between versions, which is
exactly what happened on the first attempt at this fix. Building the list in
JavaScript sidesteps the disagreement: both versions receive real filenames and
neither has to interpret anything.

**What breaks without it.** On Node 22 the test command finds no tests. The
dangerous part is that this looks like success rather than failure, so a broken
change could pass through CI unnoticed. The empty list check exists for the
same reason.

**Interview questions**

*Q: Why not pin the project to Node 20 and avoid the problem?*
A: Pinning freezes you on a version that eventually stops receiving security
patches, and it hides the problem rather than fixing it. Listing the files is
correct on every version, so nothing has to be frozen. CI now runs 20 and 22
together, so a difference between them shows up as a failure instead of a
surprise months later.

*Q: A command that finds zero tests usually exits 0, which looks identical to
everything passing. How do you protect against that?*
A: Make "nothing ran" an explicit failure, which is what the empty list check
does here. The wider principle is that silence from a checking tool must never
be read as a pass. A check that is switched off and a check that is succeeding
produce the same green tick, so the check has to prove it did some work.

## Teach the test stub about `onInstalled`

**What changed.** `tests/background.test.cjs` builds a fake `chrome` object so
the extension's service worker can run inside a test. That fake knew about
`chrome.runtime.onMessage` but not `chrome.runtime.onInstalled`. It does now.

**Why.** The worker is plain JavaScript that runs top to bottom when it loads.
Near the end it calls `chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(...)`, so that the
extension can inject itself into tabs that were already open when it was
installed. In the test there is no real browser, only our fake, and the fake had
no `onInstalled`. Reading `.addListener` off `undefined` throws, the worker
never finishes loading, and every test that needed it failed. Nine failures,
one root cause.

The fix belongs in the fake rather than in the worker. The worker is correct:
registering that listener is exactly what a real extension should do. It was the
stand in that was incomplete, and changing shipped code to suit a test would be
making the product worse to make the test pass.

**What breaks without it.** Nine of thirty nine tests fail, including every test
covering the daily quota. The quota is what stops one person draining the shared
free tier, so this is the area you least want untested.

**Interview questions**

*Q: The test failed after a change to the worker. How did you decide whether the
bug was in the test or in the code it tests?*
A: By asking which one is describing reality. A real Chrome always provides
`chrome.runtime.onInstalled`, so a worker that uses it is behaving correctly, and
a fake that omits it is an inaccurate model of the world. The test was failing
because it was wrong about Chrome, not because the worker was wrong about
anything. The useful habit is to treat a failing test as a question rather than
an instruction: it tells you two descriptions disagree, not which one to edit.

*Q: Why fake the browser at all instead of running a real one?*
A: Speed and focus. These tests cover counting logic, for example that a deep
read costs three and that the count resets at midnight, and that logic has
nothing to do with rendering a page. A fake runs in milliseconds with no browser
to install, which means it can run on every commit in CI. The trade is real: a
fake can drift from the thing it imitates, which is precisely the bug fixed
here. So fakes are right for logic, and a genuine browser is still needed to
test that the extension works in a browser.

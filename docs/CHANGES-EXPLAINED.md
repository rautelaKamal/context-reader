## List the test files instead of pointing at the folder

**What changed.** `scripts/test.mjs` ran `node --test tests/`. It now reads the
`tests` folder itself, collects every `*.test.cjs` file, and passes that list
to the runner. It also fails on purpose if the list comes back empty.

**Why.** Node's built in test runner takes a list of test files, and the two
Node versions we support disagree about what a folder name means:

* On Node 20, `tests/` is understood as a directory to look inside. Glob
  patterns are not supported.
* On Node 22, arguments are matched as glob patterns, so the plain word
  `tests/` is treated as the name of one file. No such file exists, so nothing
  runs.

Swapping one for the other just moves the breakage between versions, which is
exactly what happened on the first attempt at this fix. Building the list in
JavaScript sidesteps the disagreement: both versions receive real filenames and
neither has to interpret anything.

**What breaks without it.** On Node 22 the test command finds no tests. The
dangerous part is that this looks like success rather than failure, so a broken
change could pass through CI unnoticed. The empty list check exists for the
same reason.

**Interview questions**

*Q: Why not pin the project to Node 20 and avoid the problem?*
A: Pinning freezes you on a version that eventually stops receiving security
patches, and it hides the problem rather than fixing it. Listing the files is
correct on every version, so nothing has to be frozen. CI now runs 20 and 22
together, so a difference between them shows up as a failure instead of a
surprise months later.

*Q: A command that finds zero tests usually exits 0, which looks identical to
everything passing. How do you protect against that?*
A: Make "nothing ran" an explicit failure, which is what the empty list check
does here. The wider principle is that silence from a checking tool must never
be read as a pass. A check that is switched off and a check that is succeeding
produce the same green tick, so the check has to prove it did some work.
